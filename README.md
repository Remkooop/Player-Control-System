# Player-Control-System
  A player control system for unity 2D games learning from celeste.
  
  The player shall have Rigidbody 2D, Player Control, Player Input, Player State Check, at the same time.
  
  The Project shall be using the new input system of unity.
  
  The player will try to have the same abilities as those of Madaline.
  
  The player will end up only having the abilities of walk, jump, dash, fall and climb, as well as some skills like wall bounce, super-dash, hyper-dash and even ultral-dash.
  
  The whole project is for myself to learn to use Github and Unity that the project may have lots of bugs and won't be that complicated.
